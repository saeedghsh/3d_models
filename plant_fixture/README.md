# A Plant fixture that fits to pot

A simple fixture, composed of two rings that attach to each other with
wooden rods.  The bottom part fits to the pot.  Pretty much most of
the parameters are adjustable, to allow fitting to different pots,
different rods, and arbitrarily adjusting the number of rods and
radius of the top ring.  CAD design with
[openscad](https://openscad.org/).
